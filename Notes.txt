create a next-js app:
npx create-nextjs-app@latest practice

start the server: npm run dev


github:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add practice-origin-nextjs git@github.com:JyothikSandeep/next-js.git
git push  
git push -u practice-origin-nextjs



File system based routing:
Next Js uses files and folders based system to define routes.


Everything starts with app
inside it we can observe two folders
1.Layout.js
2.page.js


Nextjs works with react server components

react server componets ----> render only on server never on client.

we can see everthing in our console instead of developer tools

In react we use react-router-dom to add any routes but in Next js we will create a folder in app
It indicates that we are creating a new router

for suppose we created a page like a folder like about in app
inside about we have to add a page.js file inorder to redirect to that page 


Redirecting from one page to another:
If we are using react the we are using Navigate or Link form react router dom inorder solve the issue of rerendering

So In next js we also have Link but we have to import it form next js only

syntax:
import Link from "nextjs/Link"

inside jsx:
<Link href="/about">about</Link>

In react we use "to" instead of "href"


Layout:
Layout is just a wapper which is main file where every nextjs app atleast have one layout for sure.

Favicon top website logo:
If we use a image name as icon.png then by default its the favicon.

Custom components:
We can use custom components as we are using it in React.

@ in next js we are using ../components/something in react where nextjs simplyfies it by using @symbol

any file outside the app will be named as @/components/filename then it will get redirected.
